# Assesment

The Assesment application takes user input and calculates the next state on the basis of input given. We use stateChange.json to determine the value for next state.

For initial we have 4 states S0, S1, S2 & S3 with valid inputs "0","1","2" & "3". the mapping for the same is already present in stateChange.json and validInput.json. if we want to add new states and transitions we can update the same in the JSON files and the code shall handle the rest.
